# 🌸 OIBSIP Task 1 - Iris Flower Classification

This repository contains my submission for **Task 1: Iris Flower Classification** as part of the **Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship**.

---

## 📌 Task Objective

The objective of this task is to build a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species:

- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

Based on the following features:

- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Pair plots to visualize relationships between features
- Heatmap to check feature correlations
- Data normalization using StandardScaler

---

## 🤖 Model Building

- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression
- **Train-Test Split**: 80% training, 20% testing
- **Accuracy Achieved**: ~95%

## 📁 Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Iris_Classification.ipynb` | Jupyter notebook with full code |
| `iris_classification.py` | Python script version (optional) |
| `report.pdf` | Summary report (if required) |
| `iris_model.pkl` | Trained model saved using joblib (optional) |
| `screenshots/` | Folder with sample outputs and graphs (optional) |

## ✅ Results

- The Logistic Regression model was able to accurately classify the Iris species.
- Setosa is easily separable, while Versicolor and Virginica overlap slightly.
- With proper preprocessing and visualization, even simple models perform well.
